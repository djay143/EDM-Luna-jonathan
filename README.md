## About Me
I'm a first-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, driven by a passion for coding and problem-solving. With a solid foundation in C and a growing proficiency in Python, I’m actively exploring its use in software development, process automation, and efficient data management.  

As I advance in my studies, I’m eager to deepen my knowledge of programming, databases, and system analysis to understand how technology fuels innovation. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can exchange ideas, contribute to projects, and continuously refine my skills. Whether through coding challenges, hands-on projects, or future internships, I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my learning and stay updated with emerging technologies.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy experimenting with coding projects, staying informed about technological advancements, and expanding my expertise in software development. My ultimate goal is to build a strong foundation in Information Systems and develop innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and drive success in the tech industry. I’m excited for the journey ahead and the chance to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact!
